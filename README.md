To replicate the design in ReactJS, we'll break down the process into several steps. I'll guide you through creating the project, structuring the components, and implementing the layout. Let's start!

1. Setting Up the Project
First, we'll create a new React project using Create React App.

```bash
npx create-react-app taskaroo-dashboard
cd taskaroo-dashboard
npm start
```

2. File Structure
Here's how you can organize your project:
```bash
/src
|-- /assets        # For storing static files like images and fonts
|-- /components    # For reusable components
|-- /pages         # For the main pages (e.g., Dashboard)
|-- App.js         # Main App component
|-- index.js       # Entry point
|-- App.css        # Global styles
```

4. Creating Components
Let's break down the design into different components:
